Introduction
============
This is a simple url shortener service. It keeps a simple btree of short codes
that map to a url. The url is not limited to your current plone site, but
can be anything.

Viewlet
=======

You can display the shorturl redirector viewlet on any/all pages by adding
the included viewlet using zcml:

    <browser:viewlet
        name="upfront.shorturl.viewlet"
        manager="plone.app.layout.viewlets.interfaces.IAboveContent"
        class=".views.ShortURLViewlet"
        permission="zope2.View"
        layer="upfront.shorturl.interfaces.IShortURLLayer"
        />
